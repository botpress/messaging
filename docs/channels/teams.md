# Teams

Teams is mostly the same as before. So steps can be removed or simplified in the cloud

- We don't need to tell the user to setup an https endpoint since that's already done in the cloud
- The message about framework v4 still being in development is outdated so let's remove it
- When we tell the user to create the bot on the "Bot Framework Registration Page" we tell them to configure the messaging endpoint later. We don't need to wait for this step anymore so we can tell them to copy the link in the CDM ui right away
- Replace all the stuff that talks about making a json configuration by just copy pasting the info in the CDM ui
