# Telegram

## Requirements

### Create a Bot

To create a bot on Telegram, use Telegram's BotFather. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then generate an authorization token for your new bot

The name of your bot is displayed in contact details and elsewhere

The Username is a short name to be used in mentions and t.me links. Usernames are 5-32 characters long and are case insensitive but may only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores. Your bot's username must end in `bot`, such as `tetris_bot` or `TetrisBot`

## Channel Configuration

### Generate an Authorization Token

When you create a Telegram bot, Botfather will automatically generate a token. The token is a string that is required to authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API. Keep your token secure and store it safely; anyone can use it to control your bot

If your existing token is compromised or you lost it for some reason, use the `/token` command to generate a new one

### Bot Token

Copy paste your telegram bot token into the **Bot Token** channel configuration and click **Save**. Webhooks will be created automatically
