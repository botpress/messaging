# Unofficial Messaging Roadmap

_Note: this is an **unofficial** roadmap and should only serve as an example of what can be improved in messaging in the future_

**Tasks:**

- The Sandbox feature (more than 50% done)
- Add example on how to create a custom channel: https://github.com/botpress/custom-channel/blob/master/src/index.ts
- Add new channels like Discord, Reddit, Email, ...
- Add the possibility to delete content (messages, conversations, users, etc)
- Add the possibility to set custom user attributes when using the webchat and fetch those attributes when using any other channel (e.g. make an API call to fetch the user's Microsoft profile when using Teams)
- Remove the built-in authentication mechanism (clientToken) in favor of the VPC auth.
